# Yodecomp — decompilation cheat sheet

In general, you can adhere to patterns found in `OpenJKDF2`, located at `~/workspace/OpenJKDF2`. CMake should be used, and the assumed build platform is macOS and Linux. Claude is permitted to modify this file with any useful notes that will aid other/later Claudes. Use `wine` to invoke Windows toolchains and executables.

### External references
- **`~/workspace/DesktopAdventures`** — the user's own engine recreation of the *Desktop Adventures* engine (Yoda Stories / Indiana Jones' Desktop Adventures). Invaluable for asset-format and game-logic semantics when naming functions/structs. Notably `scrdoc.txt` = reverse-engineered **script opcode format** (pre-script conditions like `BumpTile`, `CheckEndItem`, `EnemyDead`, `HasItem`, `HealthLs`…), plus `SCRIPTS.md`, `README.md`. Use it to name `.DTA`/zone/script parsing code. The 10×10 grid at World+0x4B4 (stride 0x34/zone) is the map's zone grid.
- `~/workspace/OpenJKDF2` — style/naming conventions (`Module_Function`, loose-Hungarian), CMake layout.

In general, variable names should follow a loose-Hungarian Notation, where pointers start with `p` (ie, `pThing`), pointers to arrays are prefixed with `pa` (ie `paIndices`), booleans are prefixed with `b` (ie, 'Main_bMotsCompat').

## Decompiling

A decompiler instance can be accessed via `http://localhost:8089`, which is running an instance of https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp. The binary that should be accessed is `YodaDemo.exe`, which can also be found at `YodaDemo/YodaDemo.exe`.

**CRITICAL GOTCHA:** The Ghidra project has *multiple* programs open (JK.EXE, DroidWorks.exe, YodaDemo.exe, …) and the *default* active program is **JK.EXE**, not YodaDemo. The HTTP endpoints are stateless — `switch_program` does **not** persist across calls. You **must** append `program=YodaDemo.exe` to *every* request, or you will silently be reading JK.EXE (a different game). The `sithThing_*`/`jkGame_*`/`Video_*` names you see without the param are JK.EXE, not Yoda Stories.

Examples (note the mandatory `program=` param):
`http://localhost:8089/list_functions?program=YodaDemo.exe&limit=3000` - Lists YodaDemo functions.
`http://localhost:8089/decompile_function?program=YodaDemo.exe&address=0040b270` - Decompiles the function at 0x40b270.
`http://localhost:8089/get_current_program_info` - Sanity check; ignores param and shows the *default* (JK.EXE).

The richer `mcp__ghidra__*` tools are also available and take a `program`/instance argument.

**WRITE GOTCHA (worse than the read one):** `program=` is honored only for **reads**. **Mutations** (rename,
set-comment, set-prototype, etc. — both `mcp__ghidra__*` and the HTTP endpoints) always act on the
**currently-active** program, which is **JK.EXE**, and `switch_program` returns `success` but does NOT
persist (next request is JK.EXE again). Passing `program=YodaDemo.exe` to a write is silently ignored →
you will corrupt JK.EXE instead (verified 2026-07-04; e.g. renaming "YodaDemo 0x401490" actually hit
JK.EXE's `jkGame_SetDefaultSettings` at 0x401480). **To rename/annotate YodaDemo you must make
YodaDemo.exe the ACTIVE program in the Ghidra GUI first** (open/focus it in the CodeBrowser). Confirm with
`list_open_programs` → `current_program` must read `YodaDemo.exe` before any write. Then writes land correctly.

## Binary facts (established 2026-07-04)

`YodaDemo.exe` is the demo of **Yoda Stories** (LucasArts, 1997), a Win32 **MFC** application.

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Format | PE32, x86 (i386), GUI subsystem 4.0 | PE header |
| ImageBase / SectAlign / FileAlign | 0x400000 / 0x1000 / 0x200 | PE optional header |
| **Linker version** | **3.10** | PE optional header → **VC++ 4.2** |
| Build timestamp | 1997-02-18 19:31:59 UTC | PE `TimeDateStamp` |
| CRT | **static (`/MT`, LIBCMT.LIB)** — CRT funcs (`_memset`,`_malloc`,`_sprintf`) live in `.text`; **no MSVCRT import** | PE import table |
| MFC | statically linked (`NAFXCW.LIB`; no MFC42.DLL import; `Afx*`, `CImageList`, `CToolTipCtrl` symbols) | Ghidra |
| Imported DLLs | KERNEL32, USER32, GDI32, ADVAPI32, WAVMIX32, COMCTL32, WINSPOOL, comdlg32, SHELL32 | PE import table |
| Rich header | **absent** (e_lfanew=0x80) — consistent with pre-VS6 toolchain | PE parse |
| C++ EH | present (`__CxxFrameHandler`, `__CxxThrowException`, `/GX`) | Ghidra |

**Compiler conclusion: Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 (cl 10.20 / link 3.10).** Evidence: linker 3.10 + MSVCRT40 + no Rich header + 1997 date + MFC 4.2 idioms all converge.

### `.text` layout (0x401000–0x44afff, ~303 KB)

Standard MSVC link order = **app object files first, then statically-linked library objects**:
- **App code: ~0x401000 – ~0x429000** (~529 functions, mostly still `FUN_*`). *This is what we decompile & match.*
- **Library code: ~0x429000 – 0x44afff** (~1181 functions): MFC (`CImageList`, `CProgressCtrl`, `CToolTipCtrl`), WaveMix, C++ EH runtime, and CRT (`_memset`, `_atoi`, `_malloc`, `_sprintf`, `_time`, `__ftol`). *We link against the real libs; we do NOT hand-write these.*
- Boundary is approximate — a few MFC static objects (e.g. `AfxTryCleanup` @ 0x409050) are pulled into the app region by reference order.
- Biggest app function: `FUN_0040b270` (~10.8 KB) — likely the main window proc / game loop.

## Decompilation strategy (phased plan)

The five original requirements are reorganized into a dependency-ordered plan. **The critical early milestone is proving the toolchain via a bytematch on a trivial function BEFORE investing in mass decompilation.**

### ⭐ Prior art — the trail is already blazed (USE THIS)
**LEGO Island (1997)** was built with the *identical* config: **MSVC 4.20 + static MFC + Win32 GUI game + tools under wine.** The **isledecomp** project (github.com/isledecomp) solved exactly our problem. Adopt their approach wholesale:
- **`reccmp`** — their address-anchored, relocation-aware function comparator. Source functions get a marker comment `// FUNCTION: YODA 0x401230`; build the project with cl 4.2 (add **`/Zi`** — debug info does NOT change codegen but gives reccmp the recompiled addresses via PDB); reccmp diffs each function against the original at its recorded address and reports per-function match %. **Comparison is anchored by address, not layout** — so we do NOT need to solve TU boundaries / link order up front.
- **`decomp.me`** hosts MSVC 4.x compilers — use it on **day one** to experiment with matching a function *before* the local toolchain exists.
- Their wiki documents MSVC 4.2 codegen idioms — don't rediscover them.
- **Defer byte-identical whole-`.text` to the endgame.** Match functions individually first; identical layout is a deterministic end-puzzle (TU order + lib link order + masking PE timestamp/checksum).

### Phase 0 — Identify the compiler ✅ DONE
VC++ 4.2 (see table above).

### Phase 1 — Stand up the matching toolchain (unblocks everything)
1. Acquire **Visual C++ 4.2** (abandonware; WinWorld / archive.org — MSDN ISOs). Also grab **4.2b** (a patch that tweaks codegen) as a backup knob if we later get 99%-not-100%.
2. **Do NOT run the installer** (ancient 16-bit ACME setup — fights wine). Just copy the tool tree out of the ISO into `toolchain/`: `BIN\` (cl.exe + sibling DLLs C1.DLL/C1XX.DLL/C2.DLL/MSPDB*.DLL must stay together), `INCLUDE\`, `LIB\`, `MFC\INCLUDE\`, `MFC\LIB\`, `MFC\SRC\` (MFC source — huge help, message-map/vtable code matches nearly for free once class decls are right).
3. Run under `wine` on Apple-Silicon (Rosetta 2 + new WoW64 runs 32-bit PE tools; `WINEDEBUG=-all`). Set `INCLUDE`/`LIB` env; link with **`/INCREMENTAL:NO`** (incremental linking inserts thunks/padding). **Fallbacks** if wine fights: Docker+Rosetta linux/amd64 with wine or **wibo** (decomp community's minimal PE loader, what decomp.me uses); or a Windows-on-ARM VM.
4. Write a CMake toolchain file (`toolchain/msvc42-wine.cmake`) modeled on OpenJKDF2's `cmake_modules/toolchain_*.cmake`, wrapping `wine cl.exe` as the compiler.

### Phase 2 — Prove it: first bytematch ✅ CODE-MATCHED (2026-07-04)
**`FUN_00401490` (`World_CalcCompletionScore`) matched on decomp.me: instruction stream byte-identical
to the original.** Residual on decomp.me is ~0.5 % = the `.rdata` FP constant-pool references
(`$T175…$T196` = `1.0`, `100.0`, band thresholds), which are relocations that only resolve at final
link and are masked by reccmp — NOT a codegen miss. Winning source is in `docs/bytematch-candidate-401490.md`
(key trick: single result var `score`→EDI via an `else-if` chain + one trailing `return score`, so MSVC 4.2
can't fold `mov edi,VAL; mov eax,edi`). **TODO: record the exact decomp.me flag set that produced this.**
Compiler VC++ 4.2 is now confirmed by codegen, not just header inference.

Below is the original plan for reference:

- **Fence off the library region first** (side quest that also *definitively* pins the version): extract member objects from `LIBCMT.LIB`/`NAFXCW.LIB` of candidate versions (4.2 / 4.2b) and byte-match `memset`/`__ftol`/`__chkstk`/`__CxxFrameHandler` against the high region (0x429000+). A byte-exact match pins the version beyond argument AND lets us FID/hash-label all ~130 KB of library code so we never waste effort on it. Target shrinks to the ~163 KB app region.
- Pick a **suitable test function** from the app region: small (≤~100 B), leaf, **no FP** (avoids `__ftol`/x87), **no `switch`** (jump tables in `.text`), **no C++ EH** (no stack destructors → avoids the `push -1/push handler/mov eax,fs:[0]` prolog), minimal string/global refs. Yoda Stories is data-driven — DTA/tile/zone parsing has many tiny integer helpers. **Do NOT start with an MFC-derived method** (vtables + `CRuntimeClass` + message maps drag in data layout).
- **Likely flag set** (DevStudio 4.x Release default for static-MFC): `/nologo /MT /W3 /GX /O2 /D WIN32 /D NDEBUG /D _WINDOWS`. Evidence already says `/GX` (`__CxxFrameHandler`) and `/MT` (static CRT). **Brute-force the small matrix** (`/O2` vs `/O1`, `/Oy` vs `/Oy-`) — compiler runs in ms; the answer applies project-wide.
- **Compare at function level, relocation-masked** (isledecomp/reccmp style): compile the one-function TU to a `.obj`, extract the function's COFF section bytes, and compare vs the exe bytes at the known address, treating every relocation site (`call rel32` fields, absolute operands to globals/strings/imports — the `.obj` tells you which offsets) as wildcards. Everything outside reloc fields must be identical. This makes link order/image base irrelevant until the endgame.

### Phase 3 — Map compile units & document (the long grind)
- Comb the **app region** function-by-function. Contiguous runs of functions = same `.obj` (MSVC emits functions in source order per translation unit; `.rdata`/`.data` groupings and string clusters corroborate boundaries).
- **Padding note (tested 2026-07-04):** unlike JK.EXE (which spaces CUs with `0x90` runs), YodaDemo pads with **`0xCC` only**, and *every* function is 16-byte aligned (padding runs are a uniform 1–15 bytes). So **padding-run length does NOT isolate CU boundaries here** — the alignment is per-function (consistent with `/Gy`). Better CU signals for this binary: (a) **shared string/global clusters** — decompile a run of functions and see which reference the same adjacent `.rdata`/`.data` block; (b) source-order heuristics; (c) `.rdata` const-pool groupings. Also watch for **non-16-aligned gaps after padding** (e.g. `0x416301→0x41699e`) — those are un-recovered jump/switch tables or functions Ghidra missed; disassemble and define them.
- **When a compile unit is identified, RENAME every function in that unit with a shared prefix** (OpenJKDF2 convention: `Video_*`, `sithThing_*`, `Main_*`). Pick a prefix from the unit's role (e.g. `Sound_*`, `Tile_*`, `Map_*`, `Palette_*`). Use `mcp__ghidra__rename_function` / `batch_rename_function_components` with `program=YodaDemo.exe`.
- **Provisional CU tagging (do this early, before understanding each function).** Once you know a CU's
  extent from an anchor, bulk-rename its `FUN_*` to `<Prefix>_FUN_<addr>` (keeps the address, clearly
  provisional, reversible). Then *caller* decompilations show module context at a glance. A script over
  (start,end,prefix) ranges does the whole binary in seconds. See the 340-func tagging (Zone_/Iact_/
  Render_/Player_/View_/Dta_/GameData_) and the named CU outline in docs/compile-units.md.
- **Proximity corrects mis-attribution (MSVC never interleaves .objs).** All functions of one `.obj` are
  emitted contiguously, so a function's neighbors reveal its true CU — which can override a name you gave
  by behavior. Example: `Zone_ReadZaux/Zax2-4` sat *between* `Iact_*` functions (0x405ae0–0x4070e0), so
  they're in the **Iact** `.obj`, not the Zone-class `.obj` (0x405150–0x405ae0) — renamed to `Iact_Read*`.
  When a named function is wedged in a different-prefix run, re-prefix it to match its neighbors.
- Document discovered structs & signatures in Ghidra (types) and mirror them into headers under `src/`.
- Naming: loose-Hungarian — `p`=pointer, `pa`=pointer-to-array, `b`=bool (see top of file).

### Phase 4 — Scale matching
- One-by-one, write matching C per compile unit, compile with the locked toolchain, bytematch. Track match % over the app region.

### App-region module map (first pass — see docs/compile-units.md)
Segmented all 534 app functions into 27 `.rdata`/`.data`-ordered blocks; the 6 **major modules**:
`GameData` (0x401ac0–0x4042b0, reads `.dta`) · `Core utils` (0x408c60–0x40a560, called by all) ·
`Game UI/view/hints/sound` (0x40a560–0x418700, 107 funcs — `OPTIONS`/tile-hints/`goyoda` cheats/`MIDILoad`;
contains the ~10.8 KB `FUN_0040b270` main window proc) · `Logging` (0x419730–0x41b2f0, `yodalog.txt`) ·
`Settings/registry` (0x41b2f0–0x41bee0, `GameSpeed`/`LScore`) · `WorldGen + .wld save/load`
(0x41c340–0x429000, 130 funcs — `*.wld`/`ASAV44`/`Find Puzzle`). Between them, small MFC helper/exception/
doc-view classes (one vtable each). Call-flow (wrapping): **UI → WorldGen → GameData**, Core shared.
Tooling: `tools/segment_cus.py`; Ghidra dumps in `toolchain/test/cu_{refs2,calls,strings}.txt`. Module
heads are marked with plate comments in the DB (search `[MODULE]`).
**Asset parser (`.DTA`) — mapped & named. See `docs/dta-format.md`.** `Dta_Load` (0x422670) is the IFF
chunk dispatcher; 12 handlers named in the DB (`Dta_ParseZone/Zaux/Zax2/Zax3/Caux/Htsp/Actn/Puz2/Snds/
Chwp/Tnam` + `Dta_ReadZone`), each `__thiscall(CDocument*doc, CFile*pFile)` with `[Dta]` plate comments.
`CFile::Read` = vtable slot `+0x3c`. Tag table @ `.data 0x456890`. Chain: `Dta_Load`→`Dta_ParseZone`→
`Dta_ReadZone`→**Zone class** (`Zone_Ctor`/`Zone_ReadData` @ 0x405150, 18×18 grid, 0x848 bytes, 6
CDWordArrays)→MFC. **ENDF triggers world generation**, not parsing: `Worldgen_Randomize` (0x424380,
RNG seed) + `Worldgen_Populate` (0x425e30). So Dta-load and Worldgen share the `Dta_Load` loop. ZONE
record format (18×18, 3 tile layers, hotspots, IACT scripts, area/map-flag enums) documented in
`docs/dta-format.md`. TODO: CHAR handler; `src/Dta/` + `src/Zone/` match modules; Zone_ReadData internals.

### Compile units identified (progress log)
- **`World_*`** — game-state/score module. Confirmed contiguous cluster **0x401450–0x401ab9**, pinned by
  the dispatcher `World_UpdateScore` (0x401450) which sums four score components into `world+0x70`:
  `World_CalcTimeScore` (0x4019c0), `World_CalcSolvedScore` (0x401780), `World_CalcScoreFromCounter`
  (0x4016d0), `World_CalcCompletionScore` (0x401490, ✅bytematched). Plus accessor `World_GetZoneCell`
  (0x401a80). All operate on the World struct via ECX: 10×10 zone grid @ +0x4B4 (stride 0x34), totalZones
  @ +0x58, time @ +0x78/+0x7c, score @ +0x70. **Note:** +0x4B4 is referenced by ~12 functions spanning
  the whole app region — the grid is a *shared* struct, so shared-offset access is NOT a CU signal; only
  contiguity + the dispatcher's call set delimit the unit. Edges to refine: functions <0x401450 are MFC
  ctor/dtor boilerplate (may be a separate class TU); 0x401ac0+ switches to MFC `CWinApp`/`CString` code.

### Prepass: recovering un-marked code — DONE, effectively a no-op (2026-07-04)
**Conclusion: Ghidra's function coverage of the app region is already complete.** Verified with a script
using Ghidra's authoritative reference data: **all 484 call-targets in 0x401000–0x429000 are already
functions** (0 in-gap, 0 mid-func). The ~13.4 KB of "orphaned" instructions (138 runs) are NOT missed
functions — they classify as: (a) many **10-byte `[c0 j0 d1]` C++ EH continuation funclets** (referenced
by one exception-table data ptr; belong to the parent function); (b) **`[j>0]` switch-case blocks**
reached by jump tables; (c) large `[d1]` runs of **switch/jump code near the giant funcs** (e.g. the
2.4 KB run at 0x40d992 near `FUN_0040b270`); (d) a few trivial **shared vtable `ret N` stubs** (e.g.
0x40e3f0 = `ret 0x4`, referenced by 15 vtable slots). None should be made standalone functions.
**Pitfalls proven:** `find_code_gaps` is ~826 mostly-`0xCC`-padding noise; a **capstone call-scan gives
huge false positives** (misdecoded jump-table/data bytes → fake call targets); and `create_function` on
gap targets in tangled regions (tried 0x403501–0x40379f) yields **overlapping garbage bodies** — undone.
So: trust Ghidra's function list; do NOT bulk-create. Only optional cleanup: mark the shared `ret N`
vtable stubs as functions so vtable refs resolve to names.

**Ghidra scripts WORK** (`GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1`, Ghidra 12.1.2). Earlier OSGi error
(`GhidraPlaceholderBundle cannot be cast to GhidraSourceBundle`) was fixed by clearing the OSGi cache
(`~/Library/ghidra/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC/osgi/`) and restarting Ghidra. `run_script_inline` takes a Java
method body; `currentProgram`/`toAddr`/`println`/`createFunction` are in scope; use fully-qualified type
names (no imports). ghidra-mcp source: `~/workspace/ghidra-mcp` (`.../core/ProgramScriptService.java`).
**Reminder:** after a Ghidra restart, re-confirm YodaDemo.exe is the active program before any write.

### Matching progress + tooling (Phase 4 underway)
- **`src/World/World.{h,cpp}`** — first matched module, written as C++ (Yoda Stories is C++/MFC; member
  functions compile `__thiscall`, matching the originals). **4/6 World funcs byte-match 100%**:
  `UpdateScore` (0x401450, 4 call relocs), `CalcCompletionScore` (0x401490), `CalcScoreFromCounter`
  (0x4016d0), `GetZoneCell` (0x401a80). `CalcSolvedScore` (0x401780) ~98% (x87 two-accumulator register
  alloc, 9 bytes) — parked; `CalcTimeScore` (0x4019c0) pending (calls `time`/`__ftol`/ext 0x42a3e0).
- **`tools/match.py`** — compile a `.cpp`, best-fit each COMDAT function section to a `// FUNCTION: YODA
  0xADDR` marker, byte-compare vs the exe with relocations masked. **`tools/progress.py`** — completion
  dashboard: matched-bytes ÷ **128158** total app-function bytes (534 funcs, from Ghidra). Currently
  **0.66%**. Run: `python3 tools/progress.py`.
- **KEY codegen lessons (MSVC 4.2):**
  1. Each C++ function → its **own `.text` COMDAT** in the `.obj` (function-level linking on for C++).
  2. **Comparisons are emitted literally** — `v >= 0x5b` (`CMP 0x5b;JL`) ≠ `v > 0x5a` (`CMP 0x5a;JLE`).
     Mirror the exact operator/constant from the disassembly, not Ghidra's normalized `<`/`>`.
  3. A result routed through a variable to a **single return** emits `mov reg,VAL; mov eax,reg` per branch
     and keeps the reg; per-branch `return CONST` folds to `mov eax,VAL`. Match the original's shape.
  4. A store before a call that passes `this` is kept (compiler can't prove the callee won't read it) —
     e.g. `mScore=0;` survives before `mScore=CalcTimeScore();`.
  5. x87 stack-slot / register allocation depends on **local declaration order** — reorder locals to match.
  6. **CMP operand order** (`cmp width,x;jg` vs `cmp x,width;jl` for the same `x<width`) is instruction
     selection MSVC 4.2 picks internally — often NOT forceable by flipping the C expression. When a
     function is otherwise identical but a few comparisons have swapped operands + inverted jcc, it's
     permuter territory (like the parked World funcs). Verify a claimed match by **direct disassembly
     diff**, not only `tools/match.py` (its best-fit pairing can occasionally mis-report).
  7. **Register allocation is TU-context-dependent (big one).** Three byte-identical source functions
     (Dta `ParseZaux`/`ParseZax3`/`ParseZax2`) got *different* register allocations in the original
     (ESI/EDI/EBP roles rotated) purely by their position in the full `.obj`. In a partial TU only ONE
     reproduces the original's allocation. **Implication:** context-sensitive functions can't all be
     matched piecemeal — you need to reconstruct the *whole* original translation unit (all its funcs,
     in source/.text order) or use a permuter. This is a strong argument for the asm-first / full-TU
     approach for such modules. Simple leaf/accessor funcs (GetTile, etc.) are context-insensitive and
     match fine piecemeal.
- **MFC vtable calls** (e.g. `CFile::Read`): VC4.2 rejects the `__thiscall` keyword on free funcs/typedefs.
  Model the class with N dummy `virtual` methods so the real one lands at the observed vtable offset
  (`Read` = slot 15 = `+0x3c`); call it as a normal virtual. Works — see `src/Dta/Dta.h`. Non-virtual
  `__thiscall` helpers (e.g. record loaders) → model as member functions (implicitly thiscall); the
  call is a masked relocation so the exact target/name is irrelevant to the match.
- **Completion-% endgame** (user goal): the rigorous version is an **asm-first build** — disassemble all,
  assemble+link a byte-identical EXE with link.exe 3.10, then swap asm→C keeping it identical. Heavy infra;
  `tools/progress.py` gives the byte-% now without it.

### Tooling (`tools/`, all Python; run from repo root)
- **`match.py <src.cpp> [--exe ...]`** — compile the `.cpp`'s object (must exist next to it), then for each
  `// FUNCTION: YODA 0xADDR` marker, best-fit the COMDAT function to its address and byte-compare with
  relocations masked. Reports MATCH / DIFF(n) per function. (Best-fit can mis-pair near-identical funcs —
  confirm with a direct disasm diff. It also exposes `coff_functions`/`trim_pad`/`mask` for reuse.)
- **`progress.py`** — completion dashboard: compiles every `src/**/*.cpp`, sums matched bytes ÷ 128158
  total app-region function bytes (534 funcs). One number to track progress.
- **`bytematch.py --va 0x.. --obj ..`** — single-function reloc-masked compare (the original harness).
- **`permute.py <src.cpp> 0xADDR [--iters N]`** — the **permuter**. Searches source variations of one
  function (leading local-declaration order → register/x87-slot allocation; constant-comparison form
  `x<N`↔`x<=N-1`; relational operand flip), cl-compiles each, and uses the reloc-masked byte-match as
  the oracle. Stops at 0 diffs, writing `*.matched.cpp`. Only mutates the target function; keeps the rest
  of the TU as context. Use it on the reg-alloc/x87 parked near-matches. (Dedups no-op variants; splits
  `int y, x;` so counters can reorder. Slow — one `cl` per variant; run in background.)
  **Permuter TODOs (decl-order alone is NOT enough for several parked funcs):**
  - *Loop transforms* — swap the two nested loops' variable roles / iteration direction. `CalcSolvedScore`
    stayed at diff=9 through all 720 decl orderings because its miss is the outer/inner counter register
    swap (y↔x → EAX/EDX), which decl-order can't touch.
  - *Statement reordering* — permute adjacent independent statements (the `off+=4; i++;` vs call-arg-push
    scheduling that mattered for the Dta parsers). Currently only decl-order + comparison forms.
  - *Temp insertion / expression regrouping* — add/remove a scratch local or reassociate an expression to
    nudge register allocation (may help the Dta ESI/EDI/EBP rotation and `FindObjectAt`).
  - *cmp operand order* — `mutate_cmps` flips `a<b`↔`b>a` but MSVC often normalizes both to the same code
    (see `GetEdgeCode`); a real fix may need to route one operand through a temp so it's loaded first.
  - Quality-of-life: parallelize compiles (N wine procs), and hill-climb/anneal instead of exhaustive.
- **`segment_cus.py <cu_refs2.txt>`** — first-pass `.obj` segmentation from data-ref clustering (Phase 3).
- Ghidra dumps that feed the above live in `toolchain/test/cu_{refs2,calls,strings}.txt` (regen via scripts).

### Conventions
- **Define/maintain structs in Ghidra so the DECOMPILER does the idiomatic work for you.** Before
  transcribing a function, create its struct(s) in the Ghidra DB with correct field types and apply
  them (`create_struct` / a StructureDataType script, then `set_function_this_type "Zone *"` for the
  `this`, or `set_local_variable_type` / `set_function_prototype` for params). Ghidra then emits
  `this->tiles[i]`, `zone->width`, `p++`, `objects[i]->type` automatically instead of
  `*(short*)((char*)z+0xc)` — transcription becomes copy-paste. Proven: after defining `Zone` (0x848,
  `tiles` as `ushort[972]@0x10`, `objects` as `ZoneObj**@0x7ac`) and `ZoneObj`, `Zone_GetTile`
  decompiled to `this->tiles[(y*18+x)*3+layer]`. Keep the Ghidra struct and the `src/` struct in sync.
- **Trace every struct to its allocation before trusting its size, and define it once.** The correct
  size comes from the `operator_new(N)`/alloc site (e.g. `Zone`=0x848, `Tile`=0x40c, `MapEntity`=0x64,
  `IactScript`=0x30 were all pinned this way), NOT from how far field accesses happen to reach. Keep a
  single canonical definition per struct in the DB and the registry `docs/structs.md` — no duplicates.
  A struct whose size is only bounded by observed accesses is INFERRED (a TODO to trace), not done.
- **Non-idiomatic C++ in a decompilation is a signal to keep documenting, not to stop.** Messy casts
  like `*(short*)((char*)p+0x84)` or a field typed as the wrong struct (`tileArray` as `Zone*` →
  `tileArray->tiles+id*2-8`) mean a struct/type is still missing or wrong. Model it and re-check that
  the function now reads like human code (`this->tileArray[id]`). Prefer documenting over matching until
  the types are clean — matching messy casts wastes effort.
- **Matched C/C++ must be REAL, idiomatic, portable source — not machine-translated pointer math.**
  A human wrote this game; the decomp should read like human code, not Ghidra output. Concretely:
  - Walk arrays with `p++` / `arr[i]`, never `(T*)((char*)p + sizeofT)` or `*(T*)(base + byteoff)`.
    (The compiler strength-reduces `arr[i]` back into the offset walk, so it still byte-matches.)
  - No `(int)ptr` / `(int)`-casts of pointers; give functions their real pointer/enum return types.
  - Prefer struct member access (`z->width`) over `*(short*)((char*)z + 0xc)`. Explicit `_padNN[]`
    fields to hit known offsets are fine (and necessary) — but name the real fields you know.
  - The byte-match is the correctness oracle: rewrite to idiomatic form, recompile, confirm it still
    matches. If an idiomatic form breaks the match, keep the faithful form but leave a `// TODO: idiom`.
- Prefix functions per compile unit (see Phase 3). Loose-Hungarian for variables.
- Mirror OpenJKDF2 structure (`~/workspace/OpenJKDF2`): CMake, per-module source files, `Module_Function` naming.
- Progress artifacts live in `docs/`. The toolchain lives in `toolchain/`.
